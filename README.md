Running "example.py" will open a GUI window demonstrating a few different inputs.
The inputs are examples of dropdown menus,
  a text entry field, an integer entry field,
  and a floating point entry field.
When the "Save" button is pressed,
  it will ask the user for an output file location,
  then save the current value of the inputs to that location.

The `example.ui` file was made using the `designer-qt4` program.
