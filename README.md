Packages
--------

To run, install the `PyQt5` package with `python3 -mpip install --user PyQt5`.

To edit the `example.ui` file, first install the `pyqt5-tools` package
with `python3 -mpip install --user pyqt5-tools`, then run as
`pyqt5-tools designer`.

Usage
-----

Running `example.py` will open a GUI window demonstrating a few
different inputs.  The inputs are examples of dropdown menus, a text
entry field, an integer entry field, and a floating point entry field.
When the "Save" button is pressed, it will ask the user for an output
file location, then save the current value of the inputs to that
location.
